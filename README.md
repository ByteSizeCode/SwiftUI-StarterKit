# SwiftUI Playground macOS

This is basically Carson Katri's [reddit-swiftui project](https://github.com/carson-katri/reddit-swiftui) but heavily simplified. The network code was stripped out, decoupled from Reddit, web parsing dependency removed, and repurposed to deal with local data. The multiplatform counterparts were removed as this was made to experiment with functionality of SwiftUI for macOS.
